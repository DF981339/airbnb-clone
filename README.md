# Airbnb-Clone

### Web app is hosted on Vercel: https://airbnb-clone-df981339.vercel.app/

## Why and How I work on this project

#### I have learned some basics React already. Thus, I decided to give Next.js a try and level up my skills.

#### Recently, I have seen a lot of people using Tailwind CSS. I also wanted to use it and compare it to Bootstrap.

#### In this project, I used `Next.js` for UI, static rendering, server side rendering. `Tailwind CSS` for styling. `Mapbox` for map functionality. Deployed on `Vercel`.

## What I would like to improve if I had more time

- Implement the header scrolling effect like Airbnb so that the header color change based on the scroll position
- Implement the search bar style like Airbnb so the search bar change based on the user input or action
- Have more mobile view design and functionality enabled
- Fix the style of pictures of discover things to do section on big screen
- Create more dummy data to be rendered in results list and implement filter function
- Try to render map based on user's input and generate random location within a range, which makes it more real
- Fix the map size when user adjusting the window size. Currently, refreshing is needed to make the resizing happen
